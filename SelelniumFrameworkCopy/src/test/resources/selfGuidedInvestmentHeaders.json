Your responses to the risk tolerance questions Time horizon is the more significant factor for the retirement and major purchase goals, as GWP uses a glidepath approach that provides a more aggressive portfolio the farther away an investor is from their goal. The longer an investor has until retirement, for example, the larger their equity allocation. As investors approach their goal, GWP will automatically recalibrate their portfolio toward more fixed income and cash. However, investors’ answers on the risk tolerance questionnaire also impact their allocation for the major purchase and retirement goals and are used to place them into one of the three risk tilts (fixed income tilt, balanced tilt, or equity tilt). The general investing goal only uses the investor’s responses to the risk tolerance questions."
